## About LCHS Collections

[Latah County Historical Society](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/) collects, preserves, shares, and celebrates the history of Latah County in order to promote a deeper understanding of the many experiences that make up our shared past.

The "{{ site.title}}" collection presents historic photos from our Community Archives representing the people, places, and events from the town's founding to the twenty century.

This digital collection is a pilot project built in collaboration with the University of Idaho Library.
