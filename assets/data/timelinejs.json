But more important to the community, on weekdays, the hall was open to outsiders for social activities and amateur plays. Many private parties and dances were held in the hall... In December of 1916, the ranting evangelist, Bulgin, held forth in a circus tent on the vacant lot by the post office on Third Street. He was strong on fire and brimstone in the hereafter and warned 'God help you mothers who permit your innocent daughters to attend dances.' As a result all dancing was forbidden at high school parties. Father Watson, beloved rector at St. Mark's at the time, invited any young people who wanted to dance to come over to the Guild Hall, and this became a haven for well-chaperoned and orderly parties. Bulgin went on his way with pockets well-lined with cash from earnest, self-denying evangelical church members, but left an aftermath of intolerance from which the community was a long time recovering.\" - Abe Goff (1899-1984) The guild hall burned along with the church and rectory in a devastating fire August 14, 1937. Previously labeled as 30-04-095 but renumbered after identified as St Mark's (Feb 2021)"
